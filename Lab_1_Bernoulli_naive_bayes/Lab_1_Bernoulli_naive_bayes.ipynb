    "\n",
    "In the **third** notebook you will have to apply the **multinomial naive Bayes** algorithm on a **real-world dataset**. The goal is to automatically determine if a movie review is positive or negative. As this is not a toy dataset, you'll have to **optimize the code** or it will have to run for a long time\n",
    "\n",
    "In the **fourth** notebook you will have to extend the **multinomial naive Bayes** algorithm to work with **more than two classes**.\n",
